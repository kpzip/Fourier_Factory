# Fourier_Factory
# Created by Kyle 'kpzip' Schmerge and Yegor 'comrade113' Trydin
# Started on 4/22/2021
# The idea of this project is to create a program that allows you to import a .svg file and create a fourier series of rotating vectors that, when added tip to tail, 
# draw out the image by rotating.
